########Matching & Swap Logic

6) When seller accepts an offer 

    The seller’s NFT is transferred into the buyer’s ATA.(SellerVaultPDA --NFT --→   BuyerATA)
    After the seller’s NFT goes to the buyer, the seller receives the tokens the buyer offered in the trade.
    Close escrow accounts


Before Swap

SellerNFT → SellerVaultPDA (Seller of Lister NFT in its vault)
BuyerNFT  → BuyerVaultPDA (Similarly Buyers NFT in his/her pda vault)

After Swap 

SellerNFT → BuyerATA ( Seller NFT moves to buyers ATA)
BuyerNFT  → SellerATA ( Buyers NFT goes to Sellers ATA)


7) Cancel Actions (Both buyer and seller can change their mind and withdraw the offer during its listed and get back their tokens)

  1) Seller cancels listing → return NFT
  2) Buyer cancels offer → return NFT
